1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
cd to change what directory you're saying commands in
mkdir to make a folder
mv to move a file
rm -rf to delete stuff
notepad to open a file in notepad on windows
I think the language is bash, but I'm on Windows which uses shell so there are some bash commands that come included with VS Code.

2. Do you have pets? What kind?
No pets :(

3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
Google it.

4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
Someone fell off a fence and it was really funny, they were ok.

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
It is a file on your computer that runs the commands inside of it, and you can write the commands using the python language.
